# CSI105T Workshop : Stack vs Queue Visualization

An interactive web application to visualize and understand the differences between Stack (LIFO) and Queue (FIFO) data structures.

## Features

### 📚 Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the element from the top.
- **Peek (Top)**: View the top element without removing it.
- **Visuals**: Vertical stacking with the newest item at the top.

### ➡️ Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove the element from the front.
- **Peek (Front/Rear)**: View the front or rear elements.
- **Visuals**: Horizontal flow with clear Front and Rear indicators.

### 🎨 User Interface & Experience
- **Unified Input**: Single input field to add data to both structures simultaneously or individually.
- **Theme**: Clean **White/Grey monochrome theme**.
- **High Contrast Highlights**: Active elements (Top, Front, Rear) are highlighted in **Soft Grey** for clear visibility.
- **Persistence**: Data is automatically saved to local storage, surviving page reloads.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices using Tailwind CSS.
